{{< profile-picture >}}

I work as Senior Software Engineer at [Cabify][0],
a ride-sharing company based in Madrid, Spain.

Software, cooking and moutains are my biggest passion.
In this website you can see each of those passion at play.

I've been living in Madrid since 2017 and I'm on a journey to find all the best 
places to enjoy food in the city.
I'm currently working on a section for this website where I'll eventually
publish all my recommendations.

In the [Bread]({{< ref "bread" >}}) section you'll find a list of bread recipes as I love
cooking and baking.
