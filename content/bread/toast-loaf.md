## Overview

1. Mix together all the dry ingredients
2. Add water (and milk if not using the powdered milk)
3. Mix in the eggs
4. Mix in the honey
5. Mix in the butter
6. Mix in the yeast

## Cooking

40 minutes at 150°C for a 750g loaf.

## Procedure

For this recipe I recommend using a kneading machine as there are a lot of
ingredients to be added and it requires kneading for quite a long time.

Start by mixing together all the dry ingredients in a bowl.
Add all the water and mix until the water is incorporated.
Add the eggs and mix until well incorporated and the gluten is starting to form.

Continue adding slowly the honey, then followed by the cold butter, cut into cubes.

Knead until passed the Windowpane Test, add the yeast and incorporate it.
Divide into 750g pieces, this recipe should yeld two loafs.
Shape into the loaf and let it rest until it triplicated in size.

Cook in the oven for 40 minutes at 150°C with steam the entire time.

Sometime the loafs are bigger (last time I did this recipe every loaf was of 850g),
if that's the case, just add 10 minutes more for every 100g to the cooking time.

Let the loafs cool down on a wire rack.
Preserve in a plastic bag or chop it up and freeze it.
