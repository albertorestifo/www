Since I took part to a bread baking course, I've been baking bread at home.
In this section you'll find a collection of the recipes I follow.
They're not a tutorial. If you want to follow them, you should already know the
basics of bread making.

None of those recipes are my original creation, I simply tweaked them to my liking.
