## Procedure

For this recipe I recommend using a kneading machine as there are a lot of
ingredients to be added and it requires kneading for quite a long time.

Start by mixing together all the dry ingredients in a bowl.
Add all the water and mix until the water is incorporated.
Add the eggs and mix until well incorporated and the gluten is starting to form.

Continue adding slowly the honey, then followed by the cold butter, cut into cubes.
Once all the butter has been added, add the oil.

Knead until passed the Windowpane Test, add the yeast and incorporate it.

Divide into 100g pieces and make into small balls.
Let them rest in an off over with steam until they double in size.
